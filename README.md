Note: adjustment of photo metadata in IPhone will not be reflected in the EXIF data despite what some articles have told you. You can verify this yourdelf by adjusting the photo, upload it to a EXIF reader website, and see it yourself. You can also right click the image, go to details, and see the metadata, aka EXIF data, to verify it yourself. However, you can see the adjusted metadata using another IPhone correctly. My guess is that when IPhone adjusts the photo, it does not overwrite the exif data but add info about how to get to the desire value. 
You NEED to enable GPS tracking when taking the photos for this software to work.
